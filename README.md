## Architecture & Data Flow

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Radix UI. All UI logic is component-driven and uses dialogs for add/edit flows.
- **State Management**:
  - **Global**: Authentication state via React Context (`AuthContext`). Onboarding triggers if roles missing.
  - **Local**: App data (users, expenses, categories) managed in main app component, passed via props.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for data, Auth for login, FCM for notifications). All DB logic in `src/lib/firestore.ts`.
- **Expense Division**: Every expense is auto-divided among 7 apartments, payer excluded. Payment status tracked per apartment. See [`docs/features/EXPENSE_DIVISION_FEATURE.md`](docs/features/EXPENSE_DIVISION_FEATURE.md).
- **Roles**: Dual roles per user: `role` (user/admin) and `propertyRole` (tenant/owner). Onboarding required if missing. See [`docs/roles/ROLE_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/roles/ROLE_STRUCTURE.md).
- **Notifications**: Push notifications via FCM, setup in `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js` and `src/lib/push-notifications.ts`.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins manage users, categories, expenses, announcements.
- **Payment Integration**: Payment gateway logic in `src/components/payment-gateways.tsx` and [`docs/payments/PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/payments/PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).
- **Fault Reporting**: Fault reporting flows in `src/components/fault-reporting-form.tsx` and `src/app/fault-reporting/`.
- **Analytics**: Analytics logic in `src/components/analytics/`.
- **CSV Export**: Dashboard supports expense data export.

## Developer Workflow

- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Environment setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill Firebase config
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` (Turbopack, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Lint/Format**: `npm run lint`, `npm run format`
- **Testing**: Run test scripts in `tests/` and project root for expense, poll voting, and server logic
- **Debugging**: Use `get_errors` tool and test scripts to isolate and resolve issues
- **Contribution**: Fork, branch, follow code style (TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint), add/update tests, document changes, submit PR

---

## Integration Points

- **Firebase**: All backend logic (auth, DB, notifications) via Firebase SDKs. See `src/lib/firebase.ts` (client), `firebase-admin.ts` (server).
- **Netlify**: Deployment via Netlify; see `netlify/` and `netlify.toml`.
- **CSV Export**: Expense data export logic in dashboard
- **Payment Gateways**: See `src/components/payment-gateways.tsx` and related docs
- **Fault Reporting**: Dedicated flows and components

## Style Guidelines

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to convey trust and serenity, nodding to financial contexts but avoiding starkness.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure legibility and create a clean, uncluttered look.
- Accent color: Pale orange (#FFB347) used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements like 'Add Expense' button or due dates.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and easily readable interface.
- Simple, flat icons representing different expense categories for visual clarity.
- Clean, card-based layout for expenses to keep the information organized.
- Subtle transition animations on data update or when navigating between sections.

# Chapter 7: Data Models & Types

Welcome back to the Unicorn Properties development guide! In our [previous chapter](06_firestore_data_layer_.md), we went deep into the **Firestore Data Layer**, discovering where all our application's information (like expenses, users, and notifications) is securely stored and how it updates in real-time. We saw the "filing cabinet" and the "librarian" that manages all the data.

But now, a crucial question remains: How does our application know the exact *shape* of the files inside that filing cabinet? How does it make sure that an "Expense" always has an `amount` and a `description`, and that a "User" always has an `email` and an `apartment`? What if someone accidentally tries to save a "User" without an `email`? How do we prevent these kinds of errors?

That's where **Data Models & Types** come in!

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Imagine you're an architect designing a building. Before any construction begins, you create detailed **blueprints**. These blueprints show exactly where every wall, door, and window goes, what materials to use, and how big everything should be. If a builder tries to put a door where a wall is supposed to be, the blueprint immediately flags that mistake.

In a TypeScript project like Unicorn Properties, **Data Models** are like these architectural blueprints for all the information our app uses. They strictly define the `shape` and `content` of every piece of data.

This system solves the problem of:

1. **Predictability:** It ensures data is *always* structured exactly as expected. If an "Expense" is supposed to have a `date`, it *must* have one.
2. **Error Prevention:** By defining these rules upfront, TypeScript (our programming language) can catch many common mistakes *before* you even run the app. It's like having a super-smart assistant review your blueprint and say, "Hold on, you forgot the foundation here!"
3. **Code Clarity:** When new developers look at the code, they immediately understand what information a "User" or an "Expense" object must contain, making the code much easier to understand and work with.
4. **Easier Collaboration:** Everyone on the team uses the same blueprints, so there's no confusion about how data should look.

**Central Use Case:** Remember how we talked about an "Expense" having an `id`, `amount`, `description`, and `paidByApartment` in [Chapter 1](01_expense_management___logic_.md)? How does the system ensure every single expense record follows this exact structure? What if a developer accidentally tries to save an expense where the `amount` is text instead of a number?

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how our system uses **TypeScript** to create these blueprints, making our data reliable and our code robust!

### Key Concepts: The Blueprints for Your Data

Our Data Models & Types system revolves around the concept of defining the structure of data in our TypeScript code.

1. **Data Models (The Blueprint Idea):**
    * This is the abstract idea of defining what a piece of data should look like. For example, a "User Model" dictates that a user *must* have an `id`, `name`, `email`, and an `apartment`.
    * It's a logical definition of the data's structure.

2. **Types (The TypeScript Implementation):**
    * In TypeScript, we use keywords like `type` or `interface` to turn our "data model ideas" into actual code definitions.
    * These `types` tell TypeScript the expected properties (fields) of an object and what kind of values (like `string`, `number`, `boolean`) those properties should hold.
    * **Analogy:** If "Data Model" is the idea of a car's blueprint, "Type" is the specific drawing using symbols and labels that a manufacturer understands.

3. **Benefits in Action:**
    * **Autocompletion:** When you're writing code, your development tool (like VS Code) will suggest field names based on your types, saving you typing and preventing typos.
    * **Type Checking:** If you try to assign a number to a field that expects text, TypeScript will immediately show an error, stopping you before you even try to run your app.
    * **Readability:** Anyone reading your code can instantly see the expected structure of data without guessing.

### How to Use Data Models & Types

Let's look at how our application uses these "blueprints" to define the structure of key pieces of information, like an `Expense` or a `User`. All these definitions live in a single, central file: `src/lib/types.ts`.

#### 1. Defining an Expense Blueprint (`src/lib/types.ts`)

When we talk about an `Expense` object in our code, TypeScript enforces that it looks like this:

```typescript
// From src/lib/types.ts (simplified for Expense)
export type Expense = {
  id: string; // Unique ID for this expense
  description: string; // What the expense is for (e.g., "Electricity Bill")
  amount: number; // The total original amount (e.g., 700)
  date: string; // ISO date string
  paidByApartment: string; // Which apartment paid it (e.g., "T2")
  owedByApartments: string[]; // Which apartments originally owe money (e.g., ["T1", "T3", ...])
  perApartmentShare: number; // How much each apartment owes (e.g., 100)
  categoryId: string; // Category ID
  receipt?: string; // Optional: data URI for the receipt image (note the '?')
  paidByApartments?: string[]; // Apartments that have already paid their share back (optional)
};
```

**Explanation:** This `Expense` type is our blueprint. It says:

* `id` must be a `string`.
* `amount` must be a `number`.
* `receipt` is `string` but is `optional` (that's what the `?` means).
* `owedByApartments` must be an `array` of `strings`.

If you try to create an `Expense` object in your code that doesn't follow these rules, TypeScript will immediately flag an error, guiding you to fix it *before* it becomes a problem in the running app!

#### 2. Using the Expense Blueprint in Code

When our `UnicornPropertiesApp` (from [Chapter 5](05_central_application_orchestration_.md)) handles adding a new expense, it expects the data to match the `Expense` type.

```typescript
// From src/components/unicorn-properties-app.tsx (simplified)
import type { Expense } from '@/lib/types'; // Import our blueprint!
import * as firestore from '@/lib/firestore'; // For saving data

const handleAddExpense = async (newExpenseData: Omit<Expense, 'id' | 'date'>) => {
  // TypeScript helps here! newExpenseData is checked against the Expense type.
  // We omit 'id' and 'date' because they are generated automatically.

  const payingApartmentId = "T2"; // Example: current user is T2
  const allApartmentIds = ["T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5", "T6", "T7"];

  const expenseToSave: Omit<Expense, 'id'> = {
    ...newExpenseData,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    paidByApartment: payingApartmentId,
    owedByApartments: allApartmentIds.filter(id => id !== payingApartmentId),
    perApartmentShare: newExpenseData.amount / allApartmentIds.length,
    paidByApartments: [], // Nobody has paid back yet
  };

  // When addExpense (from Firestore Data Layer) is called, it *knows*
  // to expect data shaped like our Expense type.
  const savedExpense = await firestore.addExpense(expenseToSave);
  // Output: `savedExpense` will be an object that perfectly matches the `Expense` type,
  // including an 'id' generated by Firestore.
};
```

**Explanation:** Notice `newExpenseData: Omit<Expense, 'id' | 'date'>`. This is a powerful TypeScript feature! It says "this `newExpenseData` should look *almost exactly* like an `Expense`, but it won't have the `id` or `date` fields yet (because they are added later in the function)." This ensures we always pass the correct shape of data.

#### 3. Defining a User Blueprint (`src/lib/types.ts`)

Similarly, the `User` type defines what a user's profile must contain:

```typescript
// From src/lib/types.ts (simplified for User)
export type User = {
  id: string; // Unique ID for this user
  name: string; // User's display name
  email?: string; // User's email address (optional)
  role?: 'user' | 'admin'; // System Role (user or admin) - specific choices!
  propertyRole?: 'tenant' | 'owner'; // Property relationship role (tenant or owner)
  apartment: string; // Which apartment they belong to (e.g., "T2") - required
  isApproved?: boolean; // User approval status (optional)
  // ... other fields like avatar, phone, fcmToken ...
};
```

**Explanation:** This `User` type tells us:

* `id`, `name`, and `apartment` are required `strings`.
* `email` is an optional `string`.
* `role` can *only* be `'user'` or `'admin'`. If you try to assign `'guest'` to `role`, TypeScript will complain! This prevents typos and ensures valid data.

This strict definition means that whenever we access a `user` object in our code, we can be confident that it will have an `id`, `name`, and `apartment`, and that its `role` will be one of the defined values.

### Internal Implementation: What Happens Under the Hood?

Let's peek behind the curtain to understand how TypeScript enforces these blueprints and helps us catch errors.

#### High-Level Flow: Type-Driven Development

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Developer
    participant TS as TypeScript Compiler (VS Code)
    participant App as Unicorn Properties Application

    D->>D: 1. Writes code using `Expense` or `User` types
    Note over D: e.g., `const myExpense: Expense = { ... };`

    TS->>D: 2. Checks code against `types.ts` blueprints
    alt If data shape is incorrect
        TS-->>D: 3. Shows immediate error: "Property 'amount' is missing!"
        D->>D: 4. Corrects code
    else If data shape is correct
        TS-->>D: 5. Confirms code is valid
    end

    D->>App: 6. Runs the application (now confident data is shaped correctly)
    App->>App: 7. Uses data, which perfectly matches expectations
```

**Explanation:** This diagram shows the process. As the `Developer` writes code, the `TypeScript Compiler` (often integrated directly into your code editor like VS Code) constantly checks it against the `types.ts` definitions. If there's a mismatch (like a missing field or wrong type), TypeScript immediately tells the developer, allowing them to fix it right away. Only when the code adheres to all the type rules does the application actually run, leading to much more reliable software.

#### The Blueprint Hub: `src/lib/types.ts`

This single file, `src/lib/types.ts`, serves as the central repository for *all* the data models in our Unicorn Properties application. It contains the `export type` definitions for every major piece of information the app handles.

**Example `Notification` Type:**

```typescript
// From src/lib/types.ts (simplified for Notification)
export type Notification = {
  id: string;
  type: 'reminder' | 'announcement'; // Can only be these two specific values
  title: string;
  message: string;
  createdAt: string;
  toApartmentId?: string | string[]; // Can be a single ID or an array of IDs
  isRead: boolean | { [apartmentId: string]: boolean }; // Flexible read status
  // ... many other specific fields for different notification types ...
};
```

**Explanation:** This `Notification` type is a bit more complex.

* `type` is restricted to only `'reminder'` or `'announcement'`. This is a **union type** and ensures we don't accidentally create notifications of an unknown type.
* `toApartmentId` can be either a single `string` or an `array` of `strings`. This flexibility is allowed by the type definition.
* `isRead` can be a simple `boolean` (for personal notifications) or an `object` that maps apartment IDs to boolean read statuses (for announcements). This is another example of a **union type** allowing for different valid structures depending on the notification `type`.

By defining these types precisely, every part of our application that deals with notifications knows exactly what to expect from a `Notification` object, and TypeScript helps ensure that data always conforms to these rules.

#### The Checker: `tsconfig.json`

While the types are defined in `src/lib/types.ts`, it's the `tsconfig.json` file that tells the TypeScript compiler *how* to check our code and *where* to find these types.

```json
// From tsconfig.json (simplified)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017", // What JavaScript version to compile to
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"], // Libraries available
    "strict": true, // VERY IMPORTANT: Enables strict type checking!
    "noEmit": true, // Don't generate JavaScript files (Next.js handles this)
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "plugins": [ { "name": "next" } ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"] // Allows us to use `@/lib/types` instead of `../../lib/types`
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**Explanation:** The most important part here is `"strict": true`. This setting turns on all the rigorous type-checking rules in TypeScript, ensuring that our code is as safe and predictable as possible. It forces developers to be explicit about data types, preventing many common bugs. The `"paths"` configuration also helps organize our imports, making it easier to refer to files like `src/lib/types.ts` as `@/lib/types`.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, you've learned about **Data Models & Types**, which are the fundamental blueprints for all information in the Unicorn Properties application. We covered:

* The problem it solves: ensuring data consistency, preventing errors, and making code clear and reliable.
* The concept of **Data Models** as architectural blueprints for data.
* How **TypeScript** implements these models using `types` (and `interfaces`), allowing for strong type checking and developer assistance.
* How `src/lib/types.ts` is the central hub for all our data definitions, including `Expense`, `User`, and `Notification`.
* The role of `tsconfig.json` in configuring the TypeScript compiler to enforce these rules, especially with `"strict": true`.

This strong foundation in data modeling is crucial for the stability and maintainability of Unicorn Properties, making sure that every piece of information flows through the app reliably, from the moment an expense is added ([Chapter 1](01_expense_management___logic_.md)) to its storage in Firestore ([Chapter 6](06_firestore_data_layer_.md)), and its display on the user interface ([Chapter 4](04_ui_component_system_.md)).

This concludes our beginner-friendly tutorial series on the core concepts behind the `unicorn-properties-dev` project. We've journeyed from understanding shared expense logic to managing users, sending notifications, building responsive UIs, orchestrating the entire application, handling data storage, and finally, defining the very structure of our data. We hope this guide has given you a solid understanding of how the different parts of Unicorn Properties work together to create a powerful and reliable application!
